## Problem statement
-   Spending too much time to check correct answer.
-   It can be wrong to check answer due to human error.
-   Lecturer have to collecting score by ownself
-   There is an issue with separating the exam set scores for each lecturer.

## Objective
-   Able to check more answer sheets with less time and correctly.
-   Create database to collect the exam score of students.
-   Build a system to be able to check answers.

## Concepts
-   Applied image processing techniques to preprocess including image conversion, image enhancement, morphological processing and perspective warping.
-   Provided the individual scores from the answer field and perform calculations such as max, min, mean, median, mode, and SD.
-   Automatically save the answer sheets and summarize scores in a CSV file along with the graph such as scatter plot, bar plot.
-   Created a text file to identify answer sheets that contain errors for duplicate answer or circle does not fill completely.

## Conclusion
- Reduce human error.
- Reduce time.
- Can check exam score in department with high accuracy model
In contrast to other machines on the market, our machines can print in black and white on paper that is 80 grams thick. our machine has speed around  12-15 pcs/min and average accuracy 99.98%.
